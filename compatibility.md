# Mouse / Gamepad mixing support

Following is a list of games tested or reported for compability with gyro-to-mosue aiming. These ratings are possible:
- Native: This game natively supports gyro aim such that this program is unecessary. Flickstick might even be built in.
- Seamless: Mouse input blends perfectly in with controller input. No icon flickering. Right stick may still need to be unbound in game or in steam.
- Passable: Mouse input can be mixed with controller input. Minor distractions like icon flickering, possibly one or two buttons changing function when that happens.
- Conflicted: The game's controller support interferes with the ability to gyro aim and bind custom keys. Gamepad input must be masked from the game.
- Segregated: Input type is selected at the game's title screen or a similar area, completely shutting off the other input option. Arguably more convenient than Conflicted.
- None: Game does not support controllers at all. Arguably better than Conflicted.

Additional modifiers:
- Vehicle Controls: Game somtimes features weapons or vehicles that cap your aim speed and/or smooth the input, which works poorly with flickstick. An alternative binding for traditional stick-to-mouse aiming may be required.
